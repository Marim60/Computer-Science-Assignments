# Automata Theory Simulation Project

## Overview

This Java-based project simulates various automata and formal grammar models, including NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automaton), DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton), PDA (Pushdown Automaton), and CFG (Context-Free Grammar). It demonstrates the core concepts of the Theory of Computation and provides an interactive way to test these computational models.

## Features

- **NFA Simulation: Handles multiple transitions for the same input symbol and epsilon (Îµ) transitions.
- **DFA Simulation: Processes inputs with a unique transition for each state and input symbol.
- **PDA Simulation: Implements a stack-based automaton for recognizing context-free languages.
- **CFG Parser: Parses and validates strings based on user-defined context-free grammar rules.

## Technologies Used

- **Java
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Data Structures (Stacks, Trees, Graphs)
- **File Stream
